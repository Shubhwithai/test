 following is the example :

Consider the below question as an example.
Q. Which of the following is Newton's Law?
a.F = ma
b.E = mc2
c.ke = mv2
d.pe = mgh

Correct answer: (a)
Explanation: F = ma is Newton's Second Law of Motion. This law states that the force acting on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration.
